# receipt_wp3_chain_events
Repository for integrating the efforts on climate and crop sensitivities with impacts on socio-economical dimensions. 
The chain of events consists in climatic variables perturbing crop yields in hotspot regions and these shocks are then propagated to the socio-economical impacts. The chain goes beyond simple correlation links and entails causality.

**Expertiment setup**:
 - Multilinear regressions (for causality) between local meteorological variables and crop yields at a grid level;
 - A partial-equilibrium model (GLOBIOM) that links crop yields variability to socio-economical impacts.
